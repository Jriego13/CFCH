        With many non-profit organizations, volunteers and donations are the lifeblood
        of the establishment and any help, whether it be big or small, does not go unnoticed.
        At St. Francis house we accept financial help, clothes, food, and more. If you are not
        in a position to be able to provide these things but would still like
        to make a contribution feel free to check our volunteer page and submit an
        application! Otherwise do not feel obligated whatsoever to donate.
